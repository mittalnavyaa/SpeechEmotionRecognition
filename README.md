# Preprocessing RAVDESS Dataset for Speech Emotion Recognition

This repository contains `preprocess_RAVDESS.py`, a script that converts the [RAVDESS dataset](https://huggingface.co/ehcalabres/wav2vec2-lg-xlsr-en-speech-emotion-recognition) into a format compatible with the speech emotion recognition model in the same directory by processing and normalizing audio files, converting labels, and outputting preprocessed data for direct use with the Wav2Vec2 model.
